As we start this new chapter, we’re also
opening doors to mentors who want to
make a difference.
If you want to help young talents find direction in their careers, this is your opportunity. This time around, because we understand what much favor you do for us as a mentor, the 1-1 sessions are now slated for once every two weeks.
Some Mentor Responsibilities Include:
* Provide guidance and feedback to trainees throughout the six-month program.
* Share insights on real-world challenges and how to approach them. 
* Join bi-weekly check-ins to monitor progress, review deliverables, and answer questions.
