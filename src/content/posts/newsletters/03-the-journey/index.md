# The Journey.
Day after day, week after week, month after month — we’ve watched them grow into the amazing developers they are today. And honestly, we couldn’t be more proud. This journey has been as inspiring and educational for us at Iknite Space as it has been for the trainees and we believe, for you as their mentor too.
Six months ago, we reached out and asked you to help guide these young minds. Without a moment’s hesitation, you said yes, and you’ve delivered beyond expectations.
Thank you for being with us. Thank you for walking this journey alongside us. And no,this is definitely not the end.

# Presentation - Session With Ryan
![presentation with Ryan](./ryan.jpg)
Crib Connect faced some real challenges managing themselves as a team and closing out their sprints.

With multiple sprints left open, Ryan stepped in to sit with them, digging into the challenges they faced and finding ways to work around problems that felt too big to tackle alone.

They will be looking to close Sprint 5 this week.

# Trainee Highlight - Guilene Docine
![Docine](./docine.png)
	
Docine first came into Iknite Space as an Academic intern. She was with us for 3 months and then left. 

When the call for application for Iknite Space Cohort 4 was launched, she pushed through and registered though she was still in her final year at the University. 

Her zeal to learn and upgrade has kept her all through, tuggling between her school project and the demands of the training. 

At the end of the day, she defended her HND months ago, and will be completing her Training this month. 

She is fierce, resilient, strong and we are definitely excited for what to see what comes next.

# Project Highlight - Team CribConnect

Team CribConnect, originally known as Roommate Finder figured finding and pairing with roommates does not have to be so complex. Hence, crib connect connects persons looking to pair/find a roommate based on similar preference.
