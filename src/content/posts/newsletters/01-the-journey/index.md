* Installing Ubuntu
* Setting up your GitHub Account

* Introduction to Go

#### Intro to APIs

## Presentations
	
### Session with Program lead; Ryan Yoder

![group presentation with Ryan](ryan.jpg)

Learning is one thing, learning through practice is another. It hits differently.

For this edition of the newsletter, the trainees have received over four presentations from their mentors and Program Lead, covering topics already available on Moodle.

These presentations give trainees the opportunity to ask questions and get clarifications on problems faced while going through a course or working on personal/team projects.
