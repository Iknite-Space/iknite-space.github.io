Iknite Space is a hands-on training program shaping Africa’s next generation of software engineers. Based in Buea, we equip aspiring developers with the skills, mentorship, and tools they need to compete in today’s global tech industry.

Since launch, we’ve supported over 20 young engineers — helping them break barriers, build real-world solutions, and pursue opportunities across Africa’s growing tech ecosystem. 

At Iknite Space, we don’t just teach code. We build future-ready innovators.
